The red/green/refactor cycle works as follows. If we're following proper TDD then the first thing we do for some project is to write some tests for it. Naturally once we have written these tests and run them they will be failing (RED). The next step is to do whatever is necessary to the code to make the tests pass (GREEN). It is now possible that although your code is functional, it is also likely that you may have made some bad design choices so you should (REFACTOR), this is also a good time to add more tests. If you have changed your code and added new tests it is likely that you are now back to tests failing (RED).

This cycle is good because it allows us to focus first on defining behaviour of the software, then on getting the software to work properly, then on getting the design down.
