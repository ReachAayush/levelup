FILES THAT AREN'T LIKE FILES
/dev/random and /dev/null are good examples of standard inclusions on UNIX system that can be used like files but aren't really

Other examples of types of files that we use during development would be sockets, which are file descriptors (at least in C), but are used as connections where one program can write and the other can read. Named pipes are another example of this kind of file.

POSTGRES PID FILE

This was hard to do even after installing postgres :P

bash-3.2$ pwd
/Users/acoyle/Library/Application Support/Postgres/var-9.4
bash-3.2$ cat postmaster.pid
1939
/Users/acoyle/Library/Application Support/Postgres/var-9.4
1432139161

/tmp
